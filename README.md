# Damien Conroy - final project 

## Getting started
This is a project created with Truffle v3.1.2 and Webpack using AngularJS with TestRPC as the target client.
Please see [the Truffle 3 guide](http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/building-testing-frontend-app-truffle-3) for more detail.

From the project directory run `truffle compile` followed by `truffle migrate` (ensure that there is a running instance of TestRPC on port 8545 available) to build and deploy the project, then run 
`npm run build` (refer to [the Truffle 3 guide](http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/building-testing-frontend-app-truffle-3)).

Visit `localhost:8080`. The screen should look similar to the following:
